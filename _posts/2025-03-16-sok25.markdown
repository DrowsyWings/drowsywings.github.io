### Introduction

One of the biggest problem for users switching from Windows to Linux is choosing the right distribution.
The project aims to help users migrate from Windows to GNU/Linux by analyzing their system specifications, asking relevant questions, and recommending a ranked list of distributions based on their preferences.

This post will break down how we approached this problem in Sok25, focusing on two core challenges:

1. Designing a **recommendation logic** that ranks distributions based on user preferences.
2. Detecting **hardware specifications** and integrating them into the ranking logic.

### Step 1: Designing the Questionnaire

To keep things simple, we decided to limit the number of questions. Instead of overwhelming users with technical details, we settled on a set of key questions. These questions covers parameters like:

- Ease of installation
- Support for older hardware
- Quality of documentation
- Community support
- Frequency of updates (Rolling or Point)
- Preferred UI style (Windows-like or Mac-like)

Each response contributes to a "parameter" of **user preference vector**, which helps in matching the needs of user with the best-fitting distributions.

### Step 2: Selecting Initial Distributions

We initially started with a limited set of well-known beginner-friendly distributions:

- **Fedora KDE**
- **Kubuntu**
- **Lubuntu**
- **Linux Mint XFCE**
- **Linux Mint Cinnamon**

Later, **Pop!\_OS** was also added based on its popularity and user demand.

### Step 3: The Recommendation Logic

The core logic behind ranking distributions is **vector-based similarity measurement**. Each distribution is represented as a vector, with dimensions corresponding to the parameters defined in our questionnaire.

The approach works as follows:

1. **User Preference Vector**: The answers provided by the user form a vector with numerical values assigned to each preference.
2. **Predefined Distribution Vectors**: Each distribution has a corresponding vector based on predefined scores.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: The similarity between the user vector and each distribution vector is computed using a mathematical function.

> TL;DR : We are using dot product and a penalty criteria (multiplying by 0.5) for ranking the distros

#### Choosing the Right Similarity Function

Initially, we considered **cosine similarity**, but we found that **dot product** gave better results.

- **Cosine Similarity** measures how closely two vectors align in terms of direction, but it ignores magnitude.
- **Dot Product** considers both direction and magnitude, making it a better fit since we care about absolute scores.

Example:

![example](/assets/images/example.png)

According to dot product :
A>B>C
Dot Product recommends Distro A as the best choice, which makes sense.

But according to cosine similarity:
C>B>A

Distro C appear as the best match because it follows the same ratio (even though its scores are much lower).
Since we care about absolute quality in preferred criteria rather than just proportional similarity, dot product is the better approach.

Here’s how we implemented the ranking in Python:

```python
    def recommend(self):
        if not self.user_vector or not self.distro_vectors:
            return "No sufficient data to generate recommendations."

        scores = {}
        user_vector_np = np.array(self.user_vector)

        for distro, vector in self.distro_vectors.items():
            distro_vector_np = np.array(vector)
            score = np.dot(user_vector_np, distro_vector_np)

            scores[distro] = score

        sorted_indices = np.argsort(list(scores.values()))[::-1]
        ranked_recommendations = [(list(scores.keys())[i], list(scores.values())[i]) for i in sorted_indices]
        return ranked_recommendations
```

### Step 4: Handling Categorical Questions

While numerical parameters like "Ease of Installation" are easy to quantify, **categorical preferences** (e.g., "Do you prefer a Windows-like UI?") are more like binary or ternary preference and are difficult to score.

To handle this, we introduced a **penalty mechanism**:

- If a distribution does not match the user's categorical preference, a **penalty factor** (e.g., 0.5) is applied to its score.
- This ensures that distributions aligning with strong user preferences are ranked higher.

Here’s the modified code which ranks distros with penalties:

```python
  def recommend(self, penalty_factor=0.5):
        if not self.user_vector or not self.distro_vectors:
            return []  # Return an empty list instead of a string

        scores = {}
        user_vector_np = np.array(self.user_vector)
        binary_params = {"updates", "UI_Look"}

        for distro, data in self.distro_vectors.items():
            distro_vector_np = np.array(data["scores"])
            final_score = np.dot(user_vector_np, distro_vector_np)

            for param in binary_params:
                if param in self.user_binary_preferences and param in data["raw_scores"]:
                    if self.user_binary_preferences[param] != data["raw_scores"][param]:
                        final_score *= penalty_factor

            scores[distro] = final_score

        return sorted(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### Conclusion

This ranking system forms the backbone of **Win2Linux-Chooser**, helping users find the most suitable Linux distribution based on their needs. While our initial model looks good, we are still refining the parameters(questionnaire) and expanding the dataset.

Next steps include:

- **Enhancing hardware detection** to factor in compatibility scores.
- **Improving penalty logic** for better handling of categorical preferences.

This project has been an exciting challenge, and we’re looking forward to refining it further. Stay tuned for more updates!
